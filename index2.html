            <p>Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line options with a minimum of fuss. It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the source code as an array of argtable structs. The command line is then parsed according to that specification and the resulting values are returned in those same structs where they are accessible to the main program. Both tagged (<code>-v, --verbose, --foo=bar</code>) and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and the library also provides the means for generating a textual description of the command line syntax, as in the following example:</p>

div.toc button {

}
</pre>
    <div><img src="img/figure.jpg" alt="Tom Huang" class="img-rounded img-responsive figure"></div>
            <p>The argtable parsing, validation, and error reporting routines may be replaced by user-defined callbacks if desired and new argtable data types may be created to parse user-defined argument types. The parsing itself is done using GNU getopt so the parser is 100% GNU compatible. Care has also been taken to make the internal command line buffer handling secure against buffer overun attacks, as might be attempted with maliciously long command lines.</p>
            <p>It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Cygwin, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, SGI IRIX, Apple Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows platforms. It is known to compile with GCC, DJGPP, Visual C++, Open Watcom, MinGW, Texas Instruments DSP Compiler and should compile with any standard ANSI C compiler.</p>
